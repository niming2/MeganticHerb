This repository provide data for our paper _Soil properties constrain forest understory plant distributions along an elevation gradient_ published in journal Philosophical Transactions B (doi: 10.1098/rstb.2023.0373). The data include ~200 sample plots along an eleational gradient in Mont-Joseph, Quebec. We recorded the abundance of four early spring flowers and measured the soil properties of part of plots. Please read the paper for details and contact me if any questions, and remember to cite the paper if using the data :)

There are three groups of sample plot: 1) 'Creek' refers to plots near creeks; 2) 'Random' refers to the random sample plots; 3) 'Extra' refers to the nonrandom samples at high elevations to find Trillium and Claytonia.
